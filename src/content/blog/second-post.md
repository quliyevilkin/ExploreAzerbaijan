Completed in 2013 the Heydar Aliyev Center became an iconic landmark of modern Baku to shape and influence ideas and movements in an era of redeveloping Baku. Built by Zaha Hadid, the British-Iraqi architect, it represents an architecture of fluid and infinite patterns, form, shape, grid, column, surface and structure by applying a futuristic understanding of local culture and historic Islamic architecture. It loses its essence and purpose with more words you put down on paper. Better you give a visit and eyewitness it yourselves.

<b>Tips:</b> If you're visiting this place, be sure to purchase a ticket for the Retro Car Museum located on the -1st floor when buying your ticket at the ticket office. Don't miss out on visiting the museum as it showcases a fascinating collection of neo-retro automobiles. Skipping it would be a missed opportunity if you're interested in vintage cars.
