For Azerbaijanis, plov is more than a dish; dozens of varieties of Azerbaijani plov recipes are passed down from generation to generation. The essential ingredients in plov are rice and meat, but the types of meat used, the vegetables and dried fruits used, the spices used, and the way the plov is served all vary.

Enjoy the delicate taste of Chigirtma plov to appreciate the combination of chicken meat, whisked eggs, and melted butter. Also, try the fried lamb Parcha Doshamya Plov, which is greasy and heavy in calories. Try the Shirin plov with cinnamon, dried apricots, barberry, and prunes. Choose Shah-plov, the king of plovs with the shape of a big pie, for the most stunning presentation of plov. Whatever sort of plov you favor, learning about it will open your eyes to the richness and complexity of Azerbaijani culture.

A light, sour-milk-based soup made of yogurt, flour, eggs, spices, and herbs is a great meal, both on hot and cool days. The peculiarity of the dish is that it can be consumed both hot and cold. Eating Dovga is especially pleasant during the autumn weather. While it's cold outside, the steaming fragrant dovga will warm you and help restore strength. The soup's spicy sourness comes from greens and a milk base, while the dish's heartiness and richness come from eggs, flour, and rice.

Piti is Azerbaijani soup made of tail fat and vegetables cooked in an aromatic mutton bone broth. Like many other Azerbaijani dishes, it is distinguished by its rich taste.
