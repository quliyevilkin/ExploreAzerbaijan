#### About Gusar

Gusar is located in the north-east of Azerbaijan and borders with Dagestan. Most of its territory consists of fascinating mountains. The first mountain-ski resort of Azerbaijan - "Shahdag" Tourism Center, which takes its name from the famous Shahdag peak with a height of 4243 meters, is located in Gusar. Nearby is the beautiful village of Laza, surrounded by breathtaking views for those who want to hike for hours. The majority of the local population is made up of Lezgis who live in the Caucasus Mountains. It is also worth trying their traditional cuisine.

#### Let's start our Gusar tour.

Let me first explain to you how to get to Quba. If you want to go to Gusar, you should either go on the same day as Guba or on another day. Because Guba and Gusar are close regions. But unlike Guba, you must take a private car to go to Gusar. Because Gusar is relatively more mountainous, there are no taxi services or buses. If you go to Gusar by taxi and walk around, you won't find any taxis when you come back and you will have to pay much more and return. The advantages of traveling by car are:
<ul>
    <li>Travel safely to all sightseeing spots with a professional driver.</li>
    <li>Having the car with you during the whole tour.</li>
    <li>Can give good advice based on driver experience.</li>
    <li>You don't have to carry your things by hand.</li>
    <li>You can go anywhere by car</li>
</ul>

In Lezgi they call him Lazar. The village, located in a valley between the mountains, consists of two parts. The second part of the village is located on the other side of the mountain, in the territory of Gabala region, on the bank of Demirchay. They say that the inhabitants of the village migrated from there and built a new settlement and named this place Laza.

The village of Laza is located at the foot of the Great Caucasus mountain range, "Shah meadow" and Shahdag peak (4242 meters).
