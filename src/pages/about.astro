		My name is Ilkin Guliyev, and I am 20 years old. I am a university student, 
		and I started gaining experience in the tourism industry in 2021. Initially, 
		I did light translation work with my father, and later, I ventured into 
		freelance entrepreneurship. Over the past few years, I have hosted guests 
		from various countries, including India, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, 
		Saudi Arabia, Oman, and several others. While I initially focused on 
		translation work, I gradually expanded my expertise by learning about 
		different places and historical landmarks, showcasing Azerbaijan's beautiful 
		landscapes to people. I organize tours both in Baku and across all regions, 
		collaborating with multiple companies on a freelance basis and also having my 
		own clients. Initially, I worked solo, but now I organize tours both individually 
		and in groups. I assist tourists with hotel bookings, transportation arrangements, 
		and visa procedures. What motivates me the most is the satisfaction of my clients.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the future, my plan in this field is to establish a large company 
		that serves tourists. The aim of this company would be to organize tours 
		for tourists in a transparent and high-quality manner and to solve all the 
		problems they may encounter. Because I see gaps in this field, I know that the 
		service provided is not yet the best, but I have set myself the goal of achieving 
		the best.

	<p>The purpose of creating this blog page is to provide tourists with accurate 
		information and to attract a mass of tourists who are interested in participating 
		in well-organized tours. If you are planning to come to Azerbaijan, please contact me
